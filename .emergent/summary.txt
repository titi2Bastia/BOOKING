<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a private artist availability calendar application in an iterative manner. Initial development focused on core functionality: user authentication (admin/artist roles), personal and aggregated calendar views, and basic CRUD for availabilities. Key technical challenges included integrating Google Calendar and SendGrid, setting up MongoDB models, and handling JWT-based authentication. The AI engineer demonstrated a strong ability to debug, particularly fixing MongoDB serialization issues and FastAPI dependency injection problems, and ensured UI/UX adhered to modern design principles using Shadcn UI.

Subsequently, the application evolved through several major updates: first, adapting to a full-day only availability model, which required significant schema and logic changes. Second, enriching artist profiles with multimedia upload capabilities and refining the admin interface to manage these profiles. Lastly, the implementation of an admin date blocking feature was initiated, with backend and frontend modifications mostly complete, but pending final testing and confirmation of admin access and invitation flows as per the user's latest explicit request. The process involved frequent use of  for major updates and  for targeted fixes.

The goal is to build a private Artist Availability Calendar application, with a single administrator and invited DJs/musicians. The admin manages artists and invitations, views/edits all availabilities on an aggregated calendar, applies filters, exports data, and syncs one-way to Google Calendar. Artists can create an account via invitation links, manage only their profile and full-day availabilities, and cannot view other artists' data.

Key features include:
- **Authentication:** Email/password with email verification, invite-only registration.
- **Data Models:** User (id, role, email, password, timezone), ArtistProfile (nom_de_scène, téléphone, lien, tarif, logo, galerie_photo, bio), Invitation (email, token, status), AvailabilityDay (artist_id, date, note, color), BlockedDate (date, note).
- **Pages:** Minimal Login, Invite-based Signup, Artist Dashboard (personal full-day calendar, profile management), Admin Dashboard (aggregated full-day calendar, artist/invitation management, date blocking, detail view of artist profiles).
- **Business Rules:** Past dates are non-editable; future availability window is at least 12 months; unique availability per artist per day; UTC storage, user timezone display; server-side RBAC; soft-delete for audit.
- **Integrations:** SendGrid for emails, Google Calendar API with OAuth 2.0 (one-way sync for All-day events, titled Disponible — {NomDeScène} or Date bloquée).
- **UX:** Modern Shadcn UI, drag & drop calendar (initially, then click-toggle for full days), clear error messages, responsive design.
- **Admin Specifics:** Landing page minimal, no demo data visible in production UI; admin creates first artists via invitation system.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
- **UI Framework:** Shadcn UI components for a modern, consistent interface.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API access.
- **Integrations:**  for Google Calendar OAuth 2.0 and SendGrid email service.
- **Data Handling:** Pydantic for data validation/serialization, UUIDs for identifiers,  and ISO strings for date/time consistency.
- **File Upload:**  for asynchronous file operations on the backend.
- **State Management:** React's functional components and hooks.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a typical full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



- ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the core FastAPI backend application. It defines all API routes, MongoDB models (User, ArtistProfile, Invitation, AvailabilityDay, BlockedDate), authentication logic, and business rules.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially set up basic auth and CRUD for . Later updated to  for full-day bookings only. Modified  to include new fields like , , , . Implemented file upload endpoints for images. Added  model and its associated CRUD endpoints. Integrated logic to check blocked dates before allowing artist availability creation. Fixed MongoDB serialization issues for  objects and  instances.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Script to populate the database with initial test data (admin, artists, availabilities).
    -   **Changes Made**: Adapted to the  model for full-day availabilities.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Script to initialize a clean production environment with only the admin user.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to prevent demo accounts from appearing in production. Modified to be non-interactive.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component and routing configuration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented  for navigation to , , , .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles user login and redirects based on role.
    -   **Changes Made**: Refactored to be a minimal landing page with login and clear invitation-only signup message.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles artist registration via invitation token.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created for invite-based signup flow.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main interface for artists to manage their profile and availabilities.
    -   **Changes Made**: Adapted to display and manage full-day availabilities only. Integrated the  component for profile enrichment.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The central hub for administrators, displaying aggregated availabilities and managing artists/invitations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to show aggregated full-day availabilities. Enhanced artist listing to include new profile details and a view action to open . Integrated  for blocking dates.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A reusable form for artists to update their detailed profile information, including image uploads.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created to support the enriched artist profile fields.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A modal component to display an artist's full, enriched profile details for the admin.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created for the admin's detailed artist view.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Component for administrators to manage blocked dates.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created to implement the date blocking feature.

<pending_tasks>
-   Confirm Admin connection URL and redirection to .
-   Provide the exact invitation link structure for artists.
-   Provide the exact error messages for invalid/expired tokens and unauthorized admin access.
-   Generate a functional test invitation token/link in the staging environment.
-   Provide screenshots/video proof of admin login, invitation generation, and invalid link handling.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the Admin Date Blocking feature. This involved significant updates to the backend () to introduce a  model, implement CRUD endpoints for blocked dates, and modify availability validation logic to prevent artists from booking on blocked days. On the frontend, a new  component was created, and  was updated to integrate this manager and visually represent blocked dates on the aggregated calendar. A small fix was also applied to  to complete a previously truncated file section.

The work was paused at the exact moment the user made a new, explicit request for confirmation of admin access details, the invitation link format, specific error messages, and a functional test invitation link. The AI engineer has just acknowledged this request and is preparing to verify the admin connection and generate a test invitation.

<optional_next_step>
Verify admin login and redirection, then generate a test invitation token and full link for the user.
