The AI engineer iteratively built a private Artist Availability Calendar application, progressing from core authentication and CRUD for availabilities to complex features. Initial work established user roles, calendar views, and integrated Google Calendar/SendGrid. Subsequent phases introduced a full-day only availability model, enriched artist profiles with multimedia, and implemented an admin date blocking feature.

Key technical challenges included resolving MongoDB serialization, FastAPI dependency injection, and correctly serving static files via Kubernetes ingress. The engineer demonstrated adaptability by implementing features like invitation link display, invitation/artist deletion, and calendar navigation. The most recent and persistent challenge involves correctly displaying artist category-based colors (DJ/Groupe) on the admin calendar, despite multiple debugging attempts involving frontend data handling, CSS, and direct JavaScript manipulation. The user reported this coloring issue is still unresolved.

<product_requirements>
The application is a private Artist Availability Calendar for an administrator and invited DJs/musicians. The admin manages artists/invitations, views aggregated availabilities (full-day only), filters/exports data, and syncs one-way to Google Calendar. Artists register via invitations, manage their profiles and full-day availabilities, and see only their own data. Key features include email/password authentication with invite-only registration, detailed data models for users, artist profiles (with multimedia uploads like logo, gallery photos, bio, tarif), invitations, full-day availabilities, and blocked dates. UI must be modern (Shadcn UI) and responsive. Recent requirements focused on admin categorization of artists (DJ/Groupe) with distinct calendar colors, filtering/sorting artists alphabetically, and displaying artist names on calendar events with click-through to profiles.

<pending_tasks>
The primary pending task is to definitively resolve the calendar event coloring issue in the Admin Dashboard, where artist availabilities (DJ/Groupe) are not consistently displaying their assigned colors (blue/green) as reported by the user.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into debugging a persistent issue where artist availability events on the Admin Dashboard calendar were not displaying the correct category-based colors (blue for DJ, green for Groupe), despite categories being correctly assigned in the backend and debug logs confirming the categories were processed in the frontend's .

Initial attempts involved:
1.  Verifying backend data () to ensure  was sent.
2.  Frontend debugging in  with console logs to confirm  was received by the .
3.  Switching from inline styles to CSS classes (, ) defined in  and later in  with  to bypass 's default styling.
4.  Implementing a JavaScript brute force in  to manually assign  based on  and then using a  to re-apply CSS classes.
5.  The latest attempt (Chat 536-541) involved directly modifying the  property within the  array itself, based on , *before*  is called, and entirely removing the  function.

Despite these efforts, the user continues to report that the calendar events for DJ and Groupe artists are still not showing their distinct blue and green colors, appearing mostly blue. The problem seems to lie in how  consumes or applies these  properties or CSS classes.

<optional_next_step>
Re-evaluate 's styling mechanisms and directly inspect the rendered DOM elements to pinpoint why colors aren't applying.
